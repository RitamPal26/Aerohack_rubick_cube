## üß† Algorithm: Two-Phase Kociemba

This solver implements **Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm**, a powerful method that finds near-optimal solutions to the Rubik's Cube. The algorithm dramatically reduces the complex problem into two more manageable steps, or phases.

> **Why a Two-Phase Algorithm?**
> A direct approach to solving the cube requires searching through a massive number of states (\~$4.3 \\times 10^{19}$). The two-phase algorithm breaks this down by first reaching an intermediate state before proceeding to the final solved state.

#### **Phase 1: Reach the G1 Subgroup**

The goal of this phase is to get the cube into a specific subgroup of states (`G1`) where the search for a final solution is much simpler.

  * **Goal:**
      * All edge pieces are correctly oriented.
      * All corner pieces are correctly oriented.
      * The four edge pieces belonging to the middle slice are placed in that slice.
  * **Method:** An **Iterative Deepening A\* (IDA\*)** search is used to find the shortest sequence of moves to reach this state.

#### **Phase 2: Solve Within the G1 Subgroup**

Once the cube is in the `G1` state, the final solution is found using a restricted set of moves that keep the cube within this subgroup.

  * **Goal:** Solve the cube completely by only arranging the permutations of the corners and edges.
  * **Allowed Moves:** `U, U', D, D', R2, L2, F2, B2`
  * **Method:** A second **IDA\*** search is performed using only these moves to find the final solution.
