=== RUBIK'S CUBE SOLVER - ALGORITHM INFORMATION ===

Algorithm: Kociemba's Two-Phase Algorithm with IDA* Search

PHASE 1 - Reach G1 Subgroup:
  Goal: Orient all corners and edges (all orientations = 0)
        AND place middle-slice edges in middle-slice positions
  Moves: All 18 possible moves (U, U2, U', R, R2, R', etc.)
  Heuristic: Pattern Database for corner and edge orientations
  Max depth: 20 moves

PHASE 2 - Solve within G1:
  Goal: Achieve solved state using restricted move set
  Moves: Only U, U2, U', D, D2, D', F2, B2, L2, R2
  Heuristic: Pattern Database for corner and edge permutations
  Max depth: 18 moves

COORDINATE SYSTEMS:
  Corner Orientation: 3^7 = 2,187 states
  Edge Orientation: 2^11 = 2,048 states
  Corner Permutation: 8! = 40,320 states
  Edge Permutation (U/D slice): 8! = 40,320 states

PATTERN DATABASES:
  Used for admissible heuristics in IDA* search
  Pre-computed and stored in corner_pdb.dat for persistence
  Significantly reduces search space and improves performance
